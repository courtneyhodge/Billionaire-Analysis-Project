            "We introduce Docling , an easy-to-use, self-contained, MITlicensed, open-source toolkit for document conversion, that can parse several types of popular document formats into a unified, richly structured representation. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LlamaIndex, LangChain, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications. The open-source community has fully engaged in using, promoting, and developing for Docling, which gathered 10k stars on GitHub in less than a month and was reported as the No. 1 trending repository in GitHub worldwide in November 2024.\n",
            "\n",
            "With Docling , we recently open-sourced a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition that we developed and presented in the recent past (Livathinos et al. 2021; Pfitzmann et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023). Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\n",

            "\n",
            "Converting documents back into a unified machineprocessable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which often discards structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n",

            "\n",
            "Document conversion is a well-established field with numerous solutions already available on the market. These solutions can be categorized along several key dimensions, including open vs. closed source, permissive vs. restrictive licensing, Web APIs vs. local code deployment, susceptibility to hallucinations, conversion quality, time-to-solution, and compute resource requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "Figure 1: Sketch of Docling's pipelines and usage model. Both PDF pipeline and simple pipeline build up a DoclingDocument representation, which can be further enriched. Downstream applications can utilize Docling's API to inspect, export, or chunk the document for various purposes.\n",

            "The most popular conversion tools today leverage visual language models (VLMs), which process page images for direct conversion. Among closed-source solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4 (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain inaccuracies - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed in the cloud.\n",
            "\n",
            "A second class of solutions prioritizes on-premises deployment, either as Web APIs or as libraries. Examples include Adobe Acrobat, Grobid, Marker, MinerU, Unstructured, and others. These solutions often rely on multiple specialized models, such as OCR, layout analysis, and table recognition models. Docling adopts a similar approach, leveraging modular, task-specific models. This design ensures conversion without hallucinations. However, it necessitates maintaining a diverse set of models for different document components, such as formulas or figures.\n",
            "\n",
            "Within this category, Docling distinguishes itself through its permissive MIT license, allowing organizations to integrate Docling into their solutions without incurring licensing fees or adopting restrictive licenses (e.g., GPL). Additionally, Docling offers highly accurate, resource-efficient, and fast models, making it well-suited for integration with many standard frameworks.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, Docling stands out as a fundamentally hallucination-free, cost-effective, accurate, open-source library with a permissive license, offering a reliable and flexible solution for document conversion.\n",

            "\n",
            "Docling is designed in a modular fashion with extensibility in mind, and it builds on three main concepts: pipelines, parser backends, and the DoclingDocument data model as its centerpiece (see Figure 1). Pipelines and parser backends share the responsibility of constructing and enriching a DoclingDocument representation from any supported input format. The DoclingDocument data model with its APIs enable inspection, export, and downstream processing for various applications, such as RAG.\n",

            "## 3.1 Docling Document\n",
            "\n",
            "Docling v2 introduces a unified document representation, DoclingDocument , as a Pydantic data model that can express various common document features, such as:\n",
            "\n",
            "- · Text, Tables, Pictures, Captions, Lists, and more.\n",
            "- · Document hierarchy with sections and groups.\n",
            "- · Disambiguation between main body and headers, footers (furniture).\n",
            "- · Layout information (i.e., bounding boxes) for all items, if available.\n",
            "- · Provenance information (i.e., page numbers, document origin).\n",
            "\n",
            "With this data model, Docling enables representing document content in a unified manner, i.e., regardless of the source document format.\n",
            "\n",
            "Besides specifying the data model, the DoclingDocument class defines APIs encompassing document construction, inspection, and export. Using the respective methods, users can incrementally build a DoclingDocument , traverse its contents in reading order, or export to commonly used formats. Docling supports lossless serialization to (and deserialization from)\n",
            "\n",
            "JSON, and lossy export formats such as Markdown and HTML, which, unlike JSON, cannot retain all available meta information.\n",
            "\n",
            "A DoclingDocument can additionally be passed to a chunker class, an abstraction that returns a stream of chunks, each of which captures some part of the document as a string accompanied by respective metadata. To enable both flexibility for downstream applications and out-of-the-box utility, Docling defines a chunker class hierarchy, providing a base type as well as specific subclasses. By using the base chunker type, downstream applications can leverage popular frameworks like LlamaIndex or LangChain, which provide a high degree of flexibility in the chunking approach. Users can therefore plug in any built-in, self-defined, or third-party chunker implementation.\n",

            "## 3.2 Parser Backends\n",
            "\n",
            "Document formats can be broadly categorized into two types:\n",
            "\n",
            "- 1. Low-level formats , like PDF files or scanned images. These formats primarily encode the visual representation of the document, containing instructions for rendering text cells and lines or defining image pixels. Most semantics of the represented content are typically lost and need to be recovered through specialized AI methods, such as OCR, layout analysis, or table structure recognition.\n",
            "- 2. Markup-based formats , including MS Office, HTML, Markdown, and others. These formats preserve the semantics of the content (e.g., sections, lists, tables, and figures) and are comparatively inexpensive to parse.\n",
            "\n",
            "Docling implements several parser backends to read and interpret different formats and it routes their output to a fitting processing pipeline. For PDFs Docling provides backends which: a) retrieve all text content and their geometric properties, b) render the visual representation of each page as it would appear in a PDF viewer. For markup-based formats, the respective backends carry the responsibility of creating a DoclingDocument representation directly. For some formats, such as PowerPoint slides, element locations and page provenance are available, whereas in other formats (for example, MS Word or HTML), this information is unknown unless rendered in a Word viewer or a browser. The DoclingDocument data model handles both cases.\n",
            "\n",
            "PDF Backends While several open-source PDF parsing Python libraries are available, in practice we ran into various limitations, among which are restrictive licensing (e.g., pymupdf (pym 2024)), poor speed, or unrecoverable quality issues, such as merged text cells across far-apart text tokens or table columns (pypdfium, PyPDF) (PyPDFium Team 2024; pypdf Maintainers 2024).\n",
            "\n",
            "We therefore developed a custom-built PDF parser, which is based on the low-level library qpdf (Berkenbilt 2024). Our PDF parser is made available in a separate package named docling-parse and acts as the default PDF backend in Docling. As an alternative, we provide a PDF backend relying on pypdfium (PyPDFium Team 2024).\n",
            "\n",
            "Other Backends Markup-based formats like HTML, Markdown, or Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) as well as plain formats like AsciiDoc can be transformed directly to a DoclingDocument representation with the help of several third-party format parsing libraries. For HTML documents we utilize BeautifulSoup (Richardson 2004-2024), for Markdown we use the Marko library (Ming 2019-2024), and for Office XML-based formats (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) we implement custom extensions on top of the python-docx (Canny and contributors 2013-2024a), python-pptx (Canny and contributors 20132024b), and openpyxl (Eric Gazoni 2010-2024) libraries, respectively. During parsing, we identify and extract common document elements (e.g., title, headings, paragraphs, tables, lists, figures, and code) and reflect the correct hierarchy level if possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 3.3 Pipelines\n",
            "\n",
            "Pipelines in Docling serve as an orchestration layer which iterates through documents, gathers the extracted data from a parser backend, and applies a chain of models to: a) build up the DoclingDocument representation and b) enrich this representation further (e.g., classify images).\n",
            "\n",
            "Docling provides two standard pipelines. The StandardPdfPipeline leverages several state-of-the-art AI models to reconstruct a high-quality DoclingDocument representation from PDF or image input, as described in section 4. The SimplePipeline handles all markup-based formats (Office, HTML, AsciiDoc) and may apply further enrichment models as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pipelines can be fully customized by sub-classing from an abstract base class or cloning the default model pipeline. This effectively allows to fully customize the chain of models, add or replace models, and introduce additional pipeline configuration parameters. To create and use a custom model pipeline, you can provide a custom pipeline class as an argument to the main document conversion API.\n",

            "\n",
            "Each document is first parsed by a PDF backend, which retrieves the programmatic text tokens, consisting of string content and its coordinates on the page, and also renders a bitmap image of each page to support downstream operations. Any image format input is wrapped in a PDF container on the fly, and proceeds through the pipeline as a scanned PDF document. Then, the standard PDF pipeline applies a sequence of AI models independently on every page of the document to extract features and content, such as layout and table structures. Finally, the results from all pages are aggregated and passed through a post-processing stage, which eventually assembles the DoclingDocument representation.\n",

            "## 4.1 AI Models\n",
            "\n",
            "As part of Docling, we release two highly capable AI models to the open-source community, which have been developed and published recently by our team. The first model is a layout analysis model, an accurate object detector for page elements (Pfitzmann et al. 2022). The second model is TableFormer (Nassar et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023), a state-of-the-art table structure recognition model. We provide the pre-trained weights (hosted on Hugging Face) and a separate Python package for the inference code ( doclingibm-models ).\n",
            "\n",
            "Layout Analysis Model Our layout analysis model is an object detector which predicts the bounding-boxes and classes of various elements on the image of a given page. Its architecture is derived from RT-DETR (Zhao et al. 2023) and re-trained on DocLayNet (Pfitzmann et al. 2022), our popular human-annotated dataset for document-layout analysis, among other proprietary datasets. For inference, our implementation relies on the Hugging Face transformers (Wolf et al. 2020) library and the Safetensors file format. All predicted bounding-box proposals for document elements are post-processed to remove overlapping proposals based on confidence and size, and then intersected with the text tokens in the PDF to group them into meaningful and complete units such as paragraphs, section titles, list items, captions, figures, or tables.\n",
            "\n",
            "Table Structure Recognition The TableFormer model (Nassar et al. 2022), first published in 2022 and since refined with a custom structure token language (Lysak et al. 2023), is a vision-transformer model for table structure recovery. It can predict the logical row and column structure of a given table based on an input image, and determine which table cells belong to column headers, row headers or the table body. Compared to earlier approaches, TableFormer handles many characteristics of tables like partial or no borderlines, empty cells, rows or columns, cell spans and hierarchy on both column-heading and row-heading level, tables with inconsistent indentation or alignment and other complexities. For inference, our implementation relies on PyTorch (Ansel et al. 2024). The PDF pipeline feeds all table objects detected in the layout analysis to the TableFormer model, by providing an image-crop of the table and the included text cells. TableFormer structure predictions are matched back to the PDF cells during a post-processing step, to avoid expensive re-transcription of the table image-crop, which also makes the TableFormer model language agnostic.\n",

            "OCR Docling utilizes OCR to convert scanned PDFs and extract content from bitmaps images embedded in a page. Currently, we provide integration with EasyOCR (eas 2024), a popular third-party OCR library with support for many languages, and Tesseract as a widely available alternative. While EasyOCR delivers reasonable transcription quality, we observe that it runs fairly slow on CPU (see section 5), making it the biggest compute expense in the pipeline.\n",

This requires OCR or table structure recognition models to engage dynamically when layout analysis has detected such elements.\n",

The former provides a simple starting point, upon which any text-based chunking method may be applied (e.g., also drawing from the framework library), while the latter, which uses a swappable Docling chunker type, can be the more powerful one, as it can provide document-native RAG grounding via rich metadata such as the page number and the bounding box of the supporting context. For usage outside of these frameworks, users can still employ Docling chunkers to accelerate and simplify the development of their custom pipelines.\n",
